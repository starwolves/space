## Description

  

A moddable multi-threaded sci-fi community game server written in Rust with the [Bevy ECS](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine. Made to communicate exclusively with the official moddable Space Frontiers client which is being built with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
This game server is designed to run on modern processors that have multiple CPU cores.
  
### Features üêÜ
* Parallelized ECS (Entity Component System) architecture.
* High player & entity counts support for matches.
* Server-side moddable map support with sizes up to 1km by 1km with 100k+ dynamic ship cells that make up the map.
* Server-side moddable inventory support.
* Server-side moddable console commands, including rcon admin commands.
* Server-side moddable proximity and radio chat.
* Built with the concurrent [Rapier 3D Physics engine](https://rapier.rs/).
* Interpolation throttling on a per client basis to meet bandwidth usage quotas.
* Built from the ground up to support safe and secure server-side modding with content folders. 
* Fearless multi-threading and resource access across multiple threads.
* A concurrent [Doryen-FOV](https://github.com/jice-nospam/doryen-fov) algorithm.

## Getting Started

  

### Dependencies



* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

  

  

### Executing program

  

* To compile & run the game server:

```
cargo run --release
```

### Space Frontiers client
You need to get the official Space Frontiers client together with the standard client content folder to be able to connect to the server. There are no public releases of the client yet.

The client is built on top of the latest stable Godot 3 release. This also means that there are graphical artefacts present on certain hardware and the optional high quality dynamic light configuration cannot be used on low-end devices due to limited dynamic light rendering performance.

When Godot 4 is stable enough, the client will be upgraded and moved to Godot 4 for better 3D rendering.

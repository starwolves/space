## Description

*Space Frontiers is a next-generation online multiplayer game in which players find themselves within a galaxy consisting of multiple sectors and spaceships. Active co-operative and PVP gameplay takes place in and around manned spaceships. Players have to work together to run and maintain a spaceship or a fleet of spaceships. Crew members are assigned different roles with different levels of responsibilities and authorization. The manned spaceships will be tasked to jump from sector to sector which can also trigger random events; events will include player antagonists, traitor roles, alien infestations and more. Events can be customized or steered by admins and events. Therefore player communication is key, putting emphasis on the chat with optional roleplay features. A wide variety of simulated spaceship and gameplay elements will be included to ensure these scenarios will be as fun as possible.*

*Space frontiers seeks to deliver an experience that offers very high amounts of supported players for decentralized gaming communities that provide their own selections of (both client- and server-side) content, mods, gamemodes, gameplay, moderation and plugins. Communities will be tasked to host a cloud of servers, rather than just a single server. This is to provide reliable authorative computational power for the partially persistent Galaxy they host. Each server within the cloud represents an active sub-sector of the Galaxy, usually with one spaceship. We intend to support galaxies with more than one thousand active players in real-time.*

**The repository of the the sci-fi community game Space Frontiers, written in Rust with the [Bevy ECS](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine. The prototype client is made with Godot. The new client is being built with Bevy.**

**There are gameplay videos of Space Frontiers on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Qa-Y_PxzeiI).**

#### Community description:
We are by no means ordinary and revolutionary would be a better word.
There is community sovereignty, integrity, values and strong personalities together with honest beings and experienced leaders that operate in truth and good faith.

**Space Frontiers and the community are age rated 18+ ðŸ”ž. Minors may not be present without parental approval and parental supervision.**


### Features (All Moddable & Modular)
* Decentralized gameplay, each community can host their own server. ðŸ‘‘
* Parallelized Entity Component System architecture. ðŸ“¡
* Pure Rust. No garbage collection. Fast code execution. ðŸŒŸ
* Data-oriented and modular within a thread-safe and strictly compiled environment. It is easy to add and remove entities, systems, components, map cells and more simply by managing [plugins](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/plugins/) that will get compiled with the project. ðŸ”­
* Using the cutting-edge [Rapier 3D Physics engine](https://rapier.rs/). ðŸš€
* Character meshes and animations are integrated with [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) for rigging. â˜„
* Inventory system, pick up, wear, attach, place and equip items with character entities.
* Melee & projectile combat systems, damage player, ship walls or other entities with various types of damage and the ability to target specific body parts.
* Advanced bbcode chat, with support for examining entities, modular (radio) channels and proximity communication.
* Actions and tab menu's to easily interact with the world while also offering protection against cheaters.
* Configurable console commands, including rcon admin commands.
* Clients can load in custom content on a per server basis thanks to a traditional automatically shared and downloaded content folder approach.
* Cell based map support with a graphical user interface map, world and entities editor with support for sizes up to 1km by 1km with 100,000+ dynamic (de)constructable ship cells.
* Atmospherics simulation including temperature, pressure, diffusion, gravity and the vacuum of space.

## Documentation:
The technical documentation of this project is found at [docs.sf.starwolves.io](https://docs.sf.starwolves.io).

There is also a [(currently outdated) guide](https://guide.docs.sf.starwolves.io) available for code contributors.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Bevy ECS dependencies](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/#install-os-dependencies)
  

### Executing Space Frontiers

  

To compile and run Space Frontiers:
* Select latest versioned branch (not master) from this repository and clone it.
* In your terminal navigate to the project folder you have just obtained and run:

To start the server run:
```
cargo run --bin server
```

To start the new client run:
```
cargo run --bin client
```

To run Space Frontiers at maximum performance you should add the following flag to the run command:
```
--release
```

### Prototype Godot Client
You can obtain the feature-rich 0.0.3-snap7 prototype client on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yYpMun9CTT).
Ensure your server has the right git branch with the same version as the obtained Godot client and not the master branch!

The prototype client is built on top of a Godot 3.4 release.

### The new Bevy client
Currently there is full focus on recreating the client in Bevy ECS. This is the main priority and we are just getting started and it will be a while before it is of any use. The new Bevy client is integrated in the same repository.

## Contributing
This project is oriented towards long-term development, meaning it is here to stay and to be developed for some years to come.
Feedback, bug reports, suggestions and critique are very much appreciated. [Gitlab](https://gitlab.starwolves.io/starwolves/space) issues and pull requests will be reviewed and considered.

The hopes are to financially reward and/or hire the most suitable people for their contributions in the much further future.

## Description

*Space Frontiers is a next-generation online community multiplayer prototype game that seeks to support a galaxy consisting of multiple sectors and spaceships. Active cooperative and PVP gameplay takes place in and around manned spaceships together with a foundation of Role-Playing-Game features. Gamemodes and content are customizable and shaped by the players.*

*Space Frontiers seeks to deliver an experience that offers high amounts of supported players for decentralized gaming communities that provide their own selections of (both client- and server-side) content, mods, game modes, gameplay, moderation and plugins. Communities can also choose to host a cloud of servers, rather than just a single server.*

*If Faster Than Light (FTL), System Shock and Space Station 13 had a child.*

**There are gameplay videos of the new prototype on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Qr_in7tUxAM).**

### Technology

The repository contains both the server and the client. Both are entirely written in Rust with the [Bevy ECS](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine. The technology stack is cutting-edge and will serve next-generation videogames well. Space Frontiers is designed from the ground up to support modern CPUs to efficiently take advantage of any amount of available CPU cores without increasing code complexity and without chances of data races. The server and client have shared libraries and deterministic behavior for synchronizing physics states reducing bandwidth usage for each connection. The old prototype client is made with Godot 3.

### Community

Socials:

* [Forum Board](https://starwolves.io)

#### Community description

We are not ordinary, revolutionary would be a better word.
There is community sovereignty, integrity, values and strong personalities together with honest beings and experienced leaders that operate in truth and good faith.

**Space Frontiers and the community are age rated 18+ ðŸ”ž. Minors may not be present without parental approval and parental supervision.**

### Revenue sharing
The codebase is open-source. Artists and programmers are invited to become part of the development of this game.
Fifty percent of the subscription-based revenue will be registered in a treasury which will be exclusively used to pay those skilled people.
A treasury page will be created in the future.

### Features new prototype (1st person)

* Decentralized gameplay, each community can host their own server. ðŸ‘‘
* Parallelized Entity Component System architecture. ðŸ“¡
* Pure Rust. No garbage collection. Fast code execution. ðŸŒŸ
* Data-oriented and modular within a thread-safe and strictly compiled environment. It is easy to add and remove entities, systems, components, map cells and more simply by managing [plugins](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/plugins/) that will get compiled with the project. ðŸ”­
* Using the cutting-edge [bevy_xpbd](https://github.com/Jondolf/bevy_xpbd). ðŸš€
* A modular 3D and dynamically destructible / constructible map framework. â˜„
* Early inventory system implementation, equip items with character entities.
* Global chat.
* Actions and tab menus to interact with the world and entities while also offering protection against cheaters.
* Configurable console commands, including rcon admin commands.
* Clients can load custom content on a per-server basis thanks to a traditional automatically shared and downloaded content folder approach.

### Features old prototype (top-down isometric)

* Character meshes and animations are integrated with [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) for rigging.
* Inventory system, pick up, wear, attach, place and equip items with character entities.
* Melee & projectile combat systems, damage player, ship walls or other entities with various types of damage and the ability to target specific body parts.
* Advanced BBCode chat, with support for examining entities, modular (radio) channels and proximity communication.
* Cell-based map support with a graphical user interface map, world and entities editor with support for sizes up to 1km by 1km with 100,000+ dynamic (de)constructible ship cells.
* Atmospherics simulation including temperature, pressure, diffusion, gravity and the vacuum of space.

## How to test-play (Launcher)
You can get the official game launcher with automatic updates of the new prototype by supporting the project on [the store](https://store.starwolves.io). After payment, simply log in to get your download link.

Being logged in with the launcher is a requirement to try out and play this codebase unless you are trying it out locally over LAN.

[Launcher source code](https://gitlab.starwolves.io/starwolves/launcher)

## Compile from source

### Dependencies

* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Bevy ECS dependencies](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/setup/#install-os-dependencies)
  
### Developing Space Frontiers

To compile Space Frontiers:

* Select latest a versioned branch from this repository and clone it.
* In your terminal navigate to the project folder you have just obtained.

For not-lan connections ensure you are logged in with the [Space Frontiers launcher](https://store.starwolves.io).

To start the server run:

```bash
cargo run server
```

To start the new Bevy client run:

```bash
cargo run
```

To run Space Frontiers at maximum performance with a slower compile time add the following flag to the run command:

```bash
--release
```

### Old Prototype Godot Client

You can obtain the feature-rich but old prototype client on [Discord](https://discord.gg/yYpMun9CTT).
Ensure your server has the right git branch with the same version as the obtained Godot client and not the master branch!

The old prototype client is built on top of a Godot 3.4 release.

## Documentation

Generate documentation yourself for master (latest code and docs!!) or other versions:

```bash
cargo doc --no-deps --document-private-items --open
```

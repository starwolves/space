## Description

  

A modular & moddable multi-threaded sci-fi headless community game server written in Rust with the [Bevy ECS](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine. Made to communicate exclusively with the official moddable Space Frontiers client which is being built with the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).
This game server is designed to run well on modern processors that have multiple CPU cores.

### Media
You can see a video of Space Frontiers in action [here](https://youtu.be/Qa-Y_PxzeiI).
  
### Features (All Moddable & Modular)
* Parallelized ECS (Entity Component System) architecture. ðŸ“¡
* Pure Rust. No garbage collection & high parallel game logic execution speeds. ðŸŒŸ
* Data-oriented, everything is its own entity with components within a thread-safe and strictly compiled environment. It is easy to add and remove entities, systems, components, map cells and more simply by managing [plugins](https://bevyengine.org/learn/book/getting-started/plugins/) that will get compiled with the project. ðŸ”­
* Using the cutting-edge [Rapier 3D Physics engine](https://rapier.rs/). ðŸš€
* Character meshes and animations are fully integrated with [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) for rigging. â˜„
* Inventory system, pick up, wear, attach, place and equip items with character entities.
* Melee & projectile combat systems, damage player, ship walls or other entities with various types of damage and the ability to target specific body parts.
* Advanced bbcode chat, with support for examining entities, modular (radio) channels and proximity communication.
* Actions and tab menu's to easily interact with the world while also offering protection against cheaters.
* Configurable console commands, including rcon admin commands.
* Clients can load in custom content on a per server basis thanks to a traditional content folder approach. Allowing modders to create new entities such as items, characters, sounds, ship cells and MUCH more.
* Godot Addressable references are used for efficient and dynamic netcode that works well with custom content.
* Cell based map support including a GUI editor with support for sizes up to 1km by 1km with 100k+ dynamic (de)constructable ship cells as map size is currently bottlenecked by the FOV algorithm. 


## Getting Started

### Documentation
Coming soon.

### Contributions
Pushed code, feedback, bug reports, suggestions and critique are very much appreciated. Github issues will be reviewed and considered.
You can get in contact with the developers through [Discord](https://discord.gg/qcg4zPuHyU).
Aditionally you can also get in contact on Discord by contacting STARWOLF#5816 .
The idea is to financially reward and/or hire people for their contributions in the future, but it is too early for that kind of money now.
Also looking for 3D artists and lore writers, even this early into the project.

### Space Frontiers client
You can get the latest stable releases of the client at [Discord](https://discord.gg/qcg4zPuHyU) by contacting STARWOLF#5816.
Aditionally the client can be obtained at our own Matrix server without requiring you to contact anyone, more information about our Matrix on [our website](https://starwolves.io)
Ensure you select the right branch of the server that has the same version number as the client you have obtained.

The client is built on top of the latest stable Godot 3.4.x release. This also means that there are graphical artifacts present on certain hardware. The client is relatively demanding of hardware it runs on due to the limited dynamic lighting rendering performance of Godot 3.
However, most devices made for video-games should expect no such problems.

When Godot 4 is stable enough, the client will be upgraded and moved to Godot 4 for better 3D rendering in favour of the Vulkan API  which aims to resolve the aforementioned issues.

### [StarWolves.io](https://starwolves.io)
Star Wolves is a gaming community that is pioneering the game Space Frontiers by hosting official servers for it and more.
Space Frontiers allows each community of players to compile and host a server instance themselves meaning the gameplay, community moderation & server remain sovereign.
